## Project Overview

**TaskLatte** encourages healthy study habits and time management through adaptive scheduling and wellness reminders.  
While most existing tools like Google Calendar or Notion provide static lists, **TaskLatte** uses AI-driven adjustments and visual metaphors to make time management personal, dynamic, and engaging.

### Why TaskLatte?

Students today often struggle with:
- Balancing multiple classes, deadlines, and personal time.
- Overcommitting and burning out due to poor time management.
- Relying on static calendars that don’t adapt to real productivity.

**TaskLatte** solves this by generating a **personalized study and wellness plan** that evolves with you.  
Your calendar becomes a café — a visual representation of your workload — where tasks, breaks, and priorities blend together seamlessly.

---

## For Whom

**TaskLatte is designed for university students** who want to stay organized while maintaining wellness.

If you are:
- Taking multiple classes or working part-time  
- Prone to procrastination or burnout  
- Looking to integrate rest and self-care into your schedule  
- Already using tools like Google Calendar or Notion, but wanting something more adaptive  

Then **TaskLatte** is the perfect companion to help you study smarter, not harder.

## How It Works

### From the user’s perspective:

1. **Input setup:**  
   Users enter their class schedules, recurring events, and upcoming deadlines (assignments, exams, projects), along with estimated completion times.

2. **Smart scheduling:**  
   The system auto-generates a daily and weekly schedule that includes study sessions and wellness breaks using adaptive algorithms.

3. **Adaptive learning:**  
   Over time, TaskLatte learns user productivity patterns — when they focus best, how long tasks take — and adjusts schedules accordingly.

4. **Daily blends:**  
   Users receive “daily blends” summarizing tasks, goals, and wellness reminders.

5. **Café visualization:**  
   The coffee shop UI changes based on workload — from calm mornings to busy rush hours — providing a creative visualization of balance and stress levels.
